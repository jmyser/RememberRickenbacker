# The System Architecture
## System Libraries

SpriteKit

GameplayKit

CoreMotion

## Programming Languages

Swift 3

## Reasoning

Apple has complete control over the platform, so the dictate to use Swift 3 was out of my hands.  Having said that, I find it to be a wonderful language to work with and Apple has provided a terrific set of tools to use.

SpriteKit is _the_ library to use.  Combined with GameplayKit and CoreMotion there is so many possibilities.  If you can think of some functionality for use in a game, chances are it is already available in one of these packages.  Anything from two dimensional sprites to complicated physics, it is all uniform and easy to take advantage of
