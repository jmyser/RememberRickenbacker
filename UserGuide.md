An iOS Space Shooter

---

## Objective
You are the last remaining pilot trained on the newest experimental aircraft.  After your base has been destroyed in a sudden alien invasion, it is up to you to eliminate the threat and save the remainder of humanity.  Your mission is simple...

**_Destroy ALL the invaders!_**

## How to Play
### Main Menu
1. New Game - This option starts a new game

2. Scores - View the current high score

### Game Play
1. Movement - Spaceship is controled with device accelerometers...  Tilt your device to the left, ship goes left.  Tilt right, ship goes right.

2. Firing - Tapping anywhere on the screen fires your blaster

3. Scoring - Every enemy ship that is destroyed gives you 10 points.  Any ship that gets by you subtracts a point from your score.

4. Levels - You start on level 1.  When you reach 50 points, you go to level 2.  100 -> level 3.  150 -> level 4... etc.  As you increase levels the difficulty increases by increasing the rate at which enemy ships are spawned.

5. Lives - You begin with 4 lives.  Every time an enemy craft collides with you, you lose a life.  When you reach 0 lives, the game is over and the aliens have won.

### Game Over Screen
After you run out of lives and reach the end of a game, the game over screen is displayed.  This screen has the following:
1. Score - This is the score you reached for the most recent game.

2. High Score - This holds your record score and is persistent across quitting and starting the app

3. RESTART - Starts a new game
